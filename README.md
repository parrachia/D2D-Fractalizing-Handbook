## Introduction

The D2D Fractalizing Handbook is a practical guide that reflects our current understandings of best practices for inter DAOs membership granting. This project was born out of the need to create an explanatory document for future DAOs and its members, and is made public thanks to GenDAO microgrant and our desire to contribute to the community. Our objective for this project is to improve, systematize, unify internal processes and make DAO-to-DAO reputation requests as transparent as possible.

We structured this handbook by going over the general themes first and from there, divulging into the more specific. The idea is to provide one, with a simple, yet solid, intro to the subject matter with an overview of the process, practical steps and its resources.

We have separated the general process from the multiple templates we here propose. This is due to their changing nature. Tools and templates can be changed, forgotten and learned. We believe that in this landscape the most important thing is accountability, in which allows for a cultural rich foundation in responsible experimentation \(aka [not move-fast-break-things](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/27/move-slow-and-break-nothing/)\) as well as a solid governance decentralization.

## Instructions

This document should be understood more as a conversation than as a manual. It does not pretend to be a paradigm of anything, but a reflection and documentation of the process we currently understand as best practice. It is a basic guide for anyone who is member of DAO considering joining another DAO, or any DAO citizen looking to better understand the possibilities of D2D possibilities and risks.

We believe that the best way to use it is by making it yours and assimilating those parts that are applicable to your DAO. This is not intended to be exhaustive nor does it delve into all the possibilities. You will find that some parts are well defined and others that merely skim the surface. For every process, there are specific steps, but for every step there is no exact tool or instruction to complete them. It is a new process and, as such, there is always room for you to leave your special input.

## About us

At **DAOincubator** we bring together builders, activists, researchers and investors to user in the age of DAOs. We believe the blockchain and decentralized governance space can benefit greatly from a network of digital and physical locations that are conductive to knowledge production and transfer, cross-pollination, pratical research, grant applications and prototyping.

Our purpose is to create more successful DAO pilots, through research, experiments and incubation. It requires us to use cutting edge tools for decentralized governance, funding and task allocation as well establishing a future DAO oriented and managed fund.

Weâ€™re building a coordinated ecosystem of open collaboration, where people with a wide range of specializations and viewpoints can be tapped to help develop projects and ideas. By documenting our progress and our observations, we will also propagate our learning to the larger ecosystem in order to advance the thinking around the DAO design space.
