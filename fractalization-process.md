# Fractalization Process

## Introduction

**The importance of having a process**

A well-structured and mature process is one of the keys to the success of any project. And although each DAO is a World in itself, there are numerous patterns that over time we have been developing and assimilating, finding these recurring paths to help us achieve uniquely different results for each D2D interaction we embark on.

We are not going to talk about a single process. It will not be a one-off discourse either. In reality, this process is composed of many processes: we have decided to distinguish three of them, which will alternately succeed each other in the order of our work.

* A receiverDAO wants to **onboard** a applicantDAO
* An applicantDAO wants to **apply** for membership in a receiverDAO
* The actual fractalizing **vote**

## **ONBOARDING**

### 1. Preparation

Every DAO is born from specific needs. But it is very common that its members themselves do not know exactly what they want or why they should join us. It is very important to make sure the applicantDAO get to know us before applying for reputation as a DAO, so that we transmit with clarity our culture and our approach to the work that we do, thus the applicantDAO members understand the differential value that we carry.

**This preparation can be given in several ways:**

* **We orient the applicantDAO.** Its members will likely approach us with a preconceived idea about the process. ****When they start working with us, we present them a holistic view of our DAO, learning from our heuristics.
* **We onboard members of the applicantDAO.** A very important value that sets us apart ****is the flexibility, open experimentation and participation. Accepting new members and orienting them during a fractalizing process allows for more seamless integration between the DAOs.

**Why is it so important?**

* **Sharing vision and culture.** It is very important for your applicantDAO to know what they are going to get from the us and what they are not.
* **Avoid DAOs who do not fit in.** It is better not to do a job that is not part of your professional focus and refer it to other colleagues. It improves the sector, it is being honest with the client and it allows us to focus where we really can contribute.
* **Improve the value of our work.** By conveying the process and details of other encounters, we enable the applicantDAO to better understand the ecosystem complexity, which improves their ability to understand contribute with what we do.

### **1.1 Proposal**

The fractalizing usually starts from the applicantDAO's initiative. They contacts us and tell us about them and their goals and situation. Based on this, a **proposal** is formalized, materializing the ideas and objectives that the applicantDAO has in the services that we can offer to provide value in their product.

**The proposal should contain:**

* A detailed description of the roadmap that will make up the DAO.
* An estimate of the phases deadline.
* A detailed quote.
* Conditions of service.
* Materials and deliverables to be received by the client.
* On certain occasions, examples of other projects.

Although accepting or rejecting a proposal may make a priori seem like a rational decision, much of it is based on the emotional. For this reason, we must never neglect the detail, narrative, and graphics quality of our proposal: it must be a reflection of what we are offering and be clearly aligned with the identity and culture of our study.

Once the proposal has been approved, where the services are to be carried out and the objectives to be achieved have been defined, they are documented in Notion and the tasks are transferred to Asana. 



### 2. Understanding

The understanding phase allows us to establish a framework for our work. It is a series of exercises and processes that must follow a defined criteria. This way we can extract all the necessary information to help build the orientation in later phases. The conclusions in this phase will then be shared with the applicantDAO as one more documentation and validated by them. Only in this way can we eliminate such expressions as "of course" from the vocabulary of DAO2DAO relations.

**Knowing the problem**

With any quality project, whether it is product, branding, or some other type of service, it begins with the understanding phase. It is the most important part of the whole process. The key is to define the problem we are facing. Because if we fail to define the problem, we may never find an adequate solution. There are many ways to discover the problem at hand. There is no single way to do this. The understanding phase starts from day one.

This is also the time to prepare the project at the technical level. We create our projects in Abstract and then give access to all the people involved in the project. This way they can see the progress and provide feedback throughout the project. It is also the time to prepare the folder structure, organize the documentation in Notion and to begin creating tasks in Asana.

## APPLICATION



## VOTING



## genDAOâ€™s fractalizing rituals

To begin with, the onboarding procedure itself must be sketched out from start to finish. We believe that the ritual will look something like this:

On the applicantDAO sideâ€¦

* A new template for both:
  * screening
  * signaling
* Feedback
* Alchemy proposal

On the genDAO sideâ€¦

* mechanisms for checks and balances
