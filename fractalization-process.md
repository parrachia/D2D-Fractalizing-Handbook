# Fractalization Process

## Introduction

**The importance of having a process**

> We overestimate the event and underestimate the process. Every fulfilled dream occurred because of dedication to the process.

> – John C. Maxwell

A well-structured and mature process is one of the keys to the success of any project. And although each DAO is a World in itself, there are numerous patterns that over time we have been developing and assimilating, finding these recurring paths to help us achieve uniquely different results for each D2D interaction we embark on.

We are not going to talk about a single process. It will not be a one-off discourse either. In reality, this process is composed of many processes: we have decided to distinguish three of them, which will alternately succeed each other in the order of our work.

* A receiverDAO wants to **onboard** a applicantDAO
* An applicantDAO wants to **apply** for membership in a receiverDAO
* The actual fractalizing **vote**

## **Onboarding**

### 1. Preparation

Every fractalization is born from specific needs. But it is very common that DAO citizens themselves do not know exactly what they want or why they should join together. As members of the receiverDAO, it is very important to make sure the applicantDAO get to know us before applying for reputation, so that we transmit with clarity our culture and our approach to the work that we do, thus the applicantDAO members understand the differential value that we carry.

**This preparation can be given in several ways:**

* **We orient the applicantDAO.** Its members will likely approach us with a preconceived idea about the process. ****When they start working with us, we present them a holistic view of our DAO, learning from our heuristics.
* **We onboard members of the applicantDAO.** A very important value that sets us apart ****is the flexibility, open experimentation and participation. Accepting new members and orienting them prior to a fractalization allows for more seamless integration between the DAOs.

**Why is it so important?**

* **Sharing vision and culture.** It is very important for your applicantDAO to know what they are going to get from us and what they are not.
* **Avoid approaches that do not fit in.** It is better not to not approve a request that is not aligned with our values and mission. Then either helping them get there or referring to other DAOs or even other organizational structures. It improves the landscape, it is being honest with them and it allows us to focus where we really can make a difference.
* **Improve the value of our work.** By conveying the process and details of other encounters, we enable the applicantDAO to better understand the ecosystem complexity, which improves their ability to understand contribute with what we do.

Each DAO should be responsible for offering proper documentation and orientation about itself. The exercise to produce such assets can be like a gift that keeps giving.
{% endhint %}

### **1.1 Agreements**

After being brought up to speed about the DAO, it's time to learn how to join it. 

The agreements phase allows us to establish a framework for our work. It should be a series of clear specifications that must be feasible to follow but also easy to track. This way we can extract all the necessary information to help KISS \(Keep It Simple and Sane\) down the road. The conclusions in this phase will then be shared with the applicantDAO as one more documentation and validated by them. Only in this way can we eliminate such expressions as "[FUBAR](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/fubar)" from the vocabulary of DAO2DAO relations.

With any quality proposal, whether it is product, branding, or some other type of contract, it begins with agreements. It is the most important part of the whole process. The key is to define the relation we are considering. Because if we fail to define boundaries, we may never build an adequate ecosystem. There are many ways to discover and communicate boundaries. There is no single way to do this. The understanding phase starts from day one.

This is also the time to prepare at the technical level. If the applicantDAO already exists, how is it going to connect with the receiver, will the address used be kept long term? Decisions from this preparation should be mentioned in the proposal or its supporting material while shared on public channels. This way they can see the progress and provide feedback throughout the process.

{% hint style="info" %}
The main difference between orientation and agreements is that while one explains vision, tools, past events, the other is about rights and responsibilities.
{% endhint %}

Some agreements may include:

* **The applicantDAO**:
  * should read all the basic documentation about the receiverDAO
    * and from there agree with core values and non-negotiable practices
  *  must abide to a reputation cap policy
    * limiting the total amount of reputation that any member is allowed to hold, including derivative reputation \(more about drep [here](knowledge-management.md)\)
  * They must agree to use a specific setup of a multisig and/or dapp \(Alchemy, Gnosis safe\) in order to participate in the voting process
  * has the right to vote on proposals as they see fit and are themselves free to create proposals at their discretion.

## signaling

* * signaling DAOs that want to apply can start the process by filling out a template, which will contain a list of questions like these.  This “template” could be an actual form, or a pre-recorded video, or a live video presentation.
    * who?
      * Who is this incoming DAO?  Which of their members already belong to genDAO?
    * what?
      * What’s the purpose of their DAO?  And, if applicable, their business model/DAOmodel?
    * when?
      * What is the DAO’s internal roadmap?  Separately, what is their roadmap relative to genDAO?
    * where?
      * which jurisdictions are involved, which corners of the cyberspace the candidate DAO touches
    * why?
      * Why join genesis DAO?
      * Why join as a DAO rather than as several individuals?
        * In what way do they understand themselves to be a DAO? 
* feedback optional but encouraged, especially in high stakes cases
  * AMAs
  * DAOtalk thread

### **2. Proposal**

The fractalizations are born from the DAOs' needs. DAO citizens reach out to each other and after introductions are made the receiverDAO may present its needs and requirements through an **Orientation**, be it with documentation, onboarding session or both. ****Based on this, a **proposal** can be formalized, materializing compatible ideas, objectives and agreements that the applicantDAO can offer to provide value to the ecosystem.

{% hint style="info" %}
More mature DAOs will most likely have extensive documentation about itself while preDAOs might produce information on demand. 
{% endhint %}

**The proposal should contain:**

* Resources requested \(tokens, reputation\)
* About the proposers, with comms channels
* A detailed description of the applicantDAO
* When applicable, a roadmap with estimate of the stages deadlines 
* How the fractalization helps promote the receiverDAO's objectives
* A rationale for the resources requested 
* Conditions for the deliverables, if any.
* Materials, documentation, external references to support above points
* On certain occasions, examples of other proposals.

Although accepting or rejecting a proposal may make a priori seem like a rational decision, much of it is based on the emotional. For this reason, we must never neglect the detail, narrative, and graphics quality of our proposals: it must be a reflection of what it's being offering and be clearly aligned with the identity and culture of our study.

Once the proposal has been approved, where the services are to be carried out and the objectives to be achieved have been defined, they are documented in the proper channels and shared in the main channels of communication.

## Long Take

Screening 



On the applicantDAO side...

* A new template for both:
  * screening 
    * The incoming DAO’s members have to understand where they're getting into
      * At a minimum, this means reading all \[official\] documentation on the fractalizing ritual and being acquainted with genDAO’s general onboarding procedures
      * They must accept/agree to abide by those of our core practices and values that we’ve determined to be non-negotiable
      * They must agree to abide by our reputation cap 
        * limit on the total amount of cumulative rep that any member is allowed to hold, both standard rep and derivative rep \(defined below\)
      * They must agree to use a specific setup of a multisig and/or alchemy tooling in order to participate in the voting process
  * signaling DAOs that want to apply can start the process by filling out a template, which will contain a list of questions like these.  This “template” could be an actual form, or a pre-recorded video, or a live video presentation.
    * who?
      * Who is this incoming DAO?  Which of their members already belong to genDAO?
    * what?
      * What’s the purpose of their DAO?  And, if applicable, their business model/DAOmodel?
    * when?
      * What is the DAO’s internal roadmap?  Separately, what is their roadmap relative to genDAO?
    * where?
      * which jurisdictions are involved, which corners of the cyberspace the candidate DAO touches
    * why?
      * Why join genesis DAO?
      * Why join as a DAO rather than as several individuals?
        * In what way do they understand themselves to be a DAO? 
* feedback optional but encouraged, especially in high stakes cases
  * AMAs
  * DAOtalk thread
* Alchemy proposal just like any individual would have to submit. 
  * Applicants should include a link to the filled-out template, preferably with any relevant AMAs/DAOtalk threads

On the genDAO side...

* mechanisms to keep these DAOs in check
  * checks and balances
    * to help resist and mitigate rep loopholes \(e.g. rep cap exploits\)
    * to help ensure the health of the ecosystem

## APPLICATION



## VOTING



## genDAO’s fractalizing rituals

To begin with, the onboarding procedure itself must be sketched out from start to finish. We believe that the ritual will look something like this:

On the applicantDAO side…

* A new template for both:
  * screening
  * signaling
* Feedback
* Alchemy proposal

On the genDAO side…

* mechanisms for checks and balances
